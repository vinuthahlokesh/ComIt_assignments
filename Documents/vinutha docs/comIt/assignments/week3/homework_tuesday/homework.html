    <h1>What are the primitive types in JS ? Give example of each.</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, the primitive types are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>String</strong>: Represents a sequence of characters. Example: <code>"Hello, World!"</code></li>
        <li><strong>Number</strong>: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: <code>42</code> or <code>3.14</code></li>
        <li><strong>Boolean</strong>: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Undefined</strong>: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. Example: <code>let x;</code></li>
        <li><strong>Null</strong>: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Example: <code>null</code></li>
        <li><strong>Symbol</strong>: A unique and immutable value often used as an identifier for object properties. Example: <code>Symbol('description')</code></li>
        <li><strong>BigInt</strong>: An arbitrary-precision integer type that can represent integers larger than the Number type can hold. Example: <code>1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These primitive types are immutable and represent single values, unlike objects which can hold collections of values and more complex entities.</p>
    <h1>When should you use an object</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, you should use an object when you need to:</p>
    <ul>    
        <li>Group related data together: Objects allow you to store multiple values in a single entity, making it easier to manage and access related information.</li>
        <li>Represent complex entities: When you need to model real-world objects with properties and behaviors, objects are the way to go.</li>
        <li>Use key-value pairs: Objects allow you to use strings (or Symbols) as keys to access values, providing a flexible way to organize data.</li>
        <li>Implement methods: Objects can contain functions as properties, allowing you to define behaviors associated with the data they hold.</li>   
        <li>Maintain state: Objects can hold and manage state over time, making them suitable for applications that require data persistence.</li>
    </ul>   
    <p>In contrast, primitive types are best used for simple values that do not require additional structure or behavior.</p>
    <h1>When should you use an array</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, you should use an array when you need to:</p>
    <ul>        
        <li>Store a list of items: Arrays are ideal for holding collections of data, such as numbers, strings, or objects, in a sequential manner.</li>
        <li>Maintain order: Arrays preserve the order of elements, allowing you to access items by their index.</li>
        <li>Perform operations on collections: Arrays come with built-in methods for iterating, filtering, mapping, and reducing data, making it easier to manipulate collections.</li>
        <li>Handle dynamic sizes: Arrays can grow and shrink in size as needed, making them flexible for various use cases.</li>        
        <li>Use array-specific methods: Arrays have methods like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, and <code>unshift</code> for adding or removing elements, which are not available in objects.</li>
    </ul>       
    <p>In contrast, objects are better suited for representing entities with properties and methods, while arrays are designed for ordered collections of items.</p>
